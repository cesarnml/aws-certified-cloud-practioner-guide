## Section 1: Cloud Concepts

### Chapter 01 - What is Cloud Computing?

- Old days:
  - Host the entire infrastructure
  - Hire a group of developers
  - Design, build and host app

- What is cloud computing?
  - AWS (Amazon Web Services)
  - HA (High Availability)

- **6 Advantages of Cloud Computing** (MEMORIZE)
  1. Trade capital expense for variable expense
     1. CAPEX (capital expense) vs OPEX (operating expense or variable expense)
  2. Benefit from massive economies of scale
     1. AWS is a big bitch, so acquires hardware on the cheap, b.
  3. Stop guessing capacity
     1. Own nothing. Lease everything.
     2. Pay only for what you consumer, when you consume it
  4. Increase speed and agility
  5. Stop spending money running and maintaining data centers
  6. Go global in minutes

- `Virtualization` *is one of the core techologies that has enabled cloud computing to go mainstream and has given birth to cloud providers such as AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
- `Hypervisors` have made it possible to emulate the physical hardware components of a single physical server as multiple virtual components (`Virtual Machines (VMs)`)
- A `hypervisor` is essentially a piece of software that sits between the actual physical hardware and the VMs
- AWS Management Console, CLI (command-line interface), APIs (application programming interfaces)
- `Software-as-a-Service` (SaaS)

- Benefits of `virtualization`:
  1. Efficient use of hardware resources via VMs
  2. Reduced cost by sharing physical resources
  3. Self-service provisioning and scaling
  4. Improved security
  5. Flexibility in type of servers provisioned

- Cloud computing models:
  1. `Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)`
     1. `line-of-business` (LOB) applications
     2. Greatest flexibility to configure the underlying network, storage, and compute services that power LOB applicaitons
     3. Amazon Elastic Computer Cloud (EC2)
  2. `Platform as a Service (PaaS)`
     1. Examples: AWS Elastic Beanstalk, AWS OpsWorks, AWS Lambda, Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS)
  3. `Software as a Service (SaaS)`

- Cloud deployment models:
  1. `Public Cloud`
  2. `Private Cloud`
  3. `Hybrid Cloud`

Answer Summary:

- Missed one question because I didn't read the prompt properly. No biggie.
